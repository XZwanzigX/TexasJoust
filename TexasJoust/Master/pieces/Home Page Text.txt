The armour is real!
The lances are real!
The competition is real!

Lysts on the Lake is the largest competitive jousting tournament being held in the world today.Be a part of the action as trained equestrians, contesting their skill in one of medieval Europe's oldestathletic events, thunder along the tilt with the aim of establishing themselves in a position of rankamongst the top jousters in the world. This modern, mounted challenge, based on the ethics andhonour of the medieval age of chivalry, is the ultimate test of equestrian skill and training.

Lysts on the Lake is not a renaissance festival nor a dinner theater stuntshow but an actual competitive sporting event featuring some of the besthorse men and women trained in the medieval equestrian arts. The armouris real, the lances are real, the hits are real and the competition is real!Richard Garriott, award winning video game developer, entrepreneur andastronaut, has generously offered to host this spectacular tournament at the"Village of Castleton" which is nestled on his private estate in a magnificentpecan grove on the shores of Lake Austin.Come visit Castleton and cheer on your favorite knight as they undertakea variety of mounted challenges over three spectacular days, both for honourand to please you, the audience!
